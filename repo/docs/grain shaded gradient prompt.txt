I want to create a grain shaded gradient effect in html/css.
I have done this process in another software, and I apply the following steps:
1. convert content to black and white using an adjustment layer
2. apply a posterize adjustment layer to bin colors into n groups (usually 3-5)
3. add reticulation noise filter for a clean noise pattern
4. adjust gamma to midpoint peak of values for even bias of white, black, and gray values
5. adjust reticulation noise filter opacity to between 20 and 40 percent opacity

What would this look like in html/css? Can you give me an example and a sample of your output?
