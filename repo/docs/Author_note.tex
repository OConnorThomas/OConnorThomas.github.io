\section*{Author's Note}

It really began when I was growing up. Around age 12 I first started receiving money from birthdays and earning money from chores. I didn't go out and buy anything at all. I saved that money, and I had a plan for it. I wanted to make a robot that would take my money and make more for me. Of course back then my idea of a robot was a metal box on wheels that would go around the neighborhood selling lemonade.

In today's day and age your computer can do it for you. We have tools to analyze stock markets, and methods to predict their behavior with a high degree of accuracy. I became a data scientist to learn the secrets behind the numbers. Automatic stock analysis, Algo Traders, and A.I. models are very powerful technologies that can provide more precise, faster insights than any human could.

So why did I create FAS? I still have that \$650 and I promised myself I'd give it to the robot.
